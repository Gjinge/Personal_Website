## Local preview

From this directory, run `python -m http.server 8000 --bind 127.0.0.1`, then open http://127.0.0.1:8000/.

## Update content

- **CV:** replace `cv.pdf` with a reviewed, public version. Check both the PDF text and embedded links for private information before publishing.
- **Research and manuscripts:** edit the corresponding sections in `index.html`. Preserve the exact status of submitted work; add authors or paper links only when confirmed. Update the footer date when content changes.
- **Photograph:** the initial design uses a CSS JG monogram. To add a real photograph, place it in `assets/img/`, replace `.hero-monogram` with an image with descriptive alt text, and size it responsively.
- **Links:** edit existing links in `index.html`. Add academic profiles only after verifying their URLs.
- **Address change:** update the canonical URL, `og:url`, `og:image`, and Schema.org `url` in `index.html`, plus this README.
- **Appearance:** edit `assets/css/styles.css`; check desktop and mobile layouts and keyboard focus after changes.

## Visitor map

The `Visitors` section near the footer loads the MapMyVisitors interactive map. Its public statistics page is https://mapmyvisitors.com/web/1c84z and is registered for this website. The embed identifier is public, not an account credential.

- Keep exactly one `id="mapmyvisitors"` script on the page to avoid duplicate counting.
- The HTTPS script loads asynchronously. `w=a` sizes the map to its parent, which is limited to 780 px and fits mobile screens.
- MapMyVisitors processes visitor IP addresses for approximate geolocation and statistics. The page includes attribution and a privacy-policy link. Ad blockers or network restrictions can prevent the map or counting from working.
- Public-page checks and local previews with the widget enabled can contribute test visits. Do not interpret pageviews as distinct people.
- To replace the widget, obtain the new complete embed code from MapMyVisitors and update both its script URL and the statistics link in `index.html`.
